Vispera owns three solutions Storesense, Shelfsight and Core. 
The products within these solutions provide offerings for solving manuel audit problem in retail. 
CPG companies aim is to make their products visible, availabe all the time and they follow some KPIs to measure this metrics. CPG companies also position assets, position price tags, position
promotion materials to increase point of sales, to compete in terms of pricing and use promotions for marketing their products.
Storesense is the solution for CPGs. First product in this solution is Shark. Shark is a data collection tool for merhandisers, auditor and CPG's field users. These teams can be their own teams or they can use 3rd parties, distributers for field operations.

Shark is a mobile app for both iOS and Android and it start with login screen, there are 4 stacks in backend so users select project is as stack code, username and password.  After loging users land to assignments screen if more then one assignment exists. Here users have sync assignments button and assignment cards to select. If there is one assignment it is automaitcally skipped in user flow. Assignment card has survey name and route name details. 

All assignments are linked to Survey model in MDM. MDM is the configuration product of the Storesense solution.  Assignments have frequency details, MDM executives who configures the projects can enter frequency of visits for example Always, Weekly, Monthly, Daily. For example Monthly  with  5 target is a valid configuration. Some of them such as Always means there is no target the store can in route can be visited any time without target control.Routes are linked to Assignments, Assignments are linked to Surveys and Surveys are linked to Project model in mdm. Project is the top hierarchy model. Then comes Survey. Auditor is the Shark user model in MDM. When an audior is generated an automatic Team is also created with same name. Team holds one or many auditors. A supervisor can be mapped to a team group. Team group is another model that can hierarchially hold one or more teams. In Shark after assignment selection user lands to Store Selection screen. Here all stores in assignment's route are listed. In MDM routes hold one or many store or store groups. IN MDM Store groups are list of stores and in MDM Store is another model that holds store metadata for example store's latitude and langitude, name, store tags. Tags are json models in MDM that can be generated hierarhically and assigned to stores so that stores can hold customizable tags. Store model also have properties field and this field holds custom texts in forms of key, value pairs.

In Shark after assignment selection user lands to store selection. This page has 2 views Map view and list view. Default view is list view. In List screen users can search by store tags, name or address.  Stores can be filtered by all stores, stores to do and stores completed. Stores can be sorted by name or nearest first. Under these interactions there are list of store cards. In store cards users reach List Visit Date, Last Visit Report, Previous Visits, On Device Report, store name, store code, store address, store tags, coverage details in form of 3/5 for example 3 visit made 5 is the target. When store card clicked if target is not exceeded user lands to Visit page this means user started a visit. When previous visits is clicked a drawer opens listing previous visit reports, when last report clicked the online mobile report opens, when on device report clicked the on device (offline) report opens. 

Activity Category is another model in MDM. Activites are mapped to Surveys. For example an activity can be Beer, Confectionnary meaning image sets will be collected. An activity can be Questionnaire meaning that user will not capture image set or simply photoshoot instead user will provide inputs to questionnaires. Image set types are another model in MDM. Image set types are mapped to activity categories. For example Shelf, Cooler, POSM can be defined. And once these are assigned to activities the activities that can be made within store by Shark user is defined. For example if there is a Beer category and Cooler image set type this means auditor or Shark user will collect images of a cooler. İf also a questionnaire which is another MDM model is mapped to same category then user will also answer questions within questionnaire.

When a store card is clicked and user lands to Visit screen. In this screen on top is store card and near it here is + button to capture store images. Also there is a questionnaire button to provide answers. At the bottom there is a button Add Activity. When user pushes it the list of activity categories assigned to survey are listed. 

In MDM there is a model called Rule. Rules are json logics and in this activities can be customized to be shown to user at project, store pool, store, survey level.

User choses one of the acitivities and lands to Activity screen. If the type of activity is Questionnaire then only answers are filled. If it is image set activity then there will be a photo capturing activirty. There is a button in Activity screen to Add Image Set types for image set type activities it is active and user select one of the image set types to provide the information what equipment's photo will be collected.

After image set type selection user lands to QR code Barcode reading screen for configured surveys. This screen is a camera view and user points camera to qr code or barcode works both of them. Code is automatically read and saved to image set. If barcode reading is configured optional in MDM then user also have the option to skip as a button.

Ocean is the backend and reporting web frontend platform. Each visit in Shark will be sent to Ocean in a data model where the model name is visit, and the data json structure is under visit there are activities and activities has image set details under if there is an activity with type imageset that is mapped to activity.

After optional barcode reading screen user lands to classic photo capture or AR photo capture. What type of image capturing flow will be active is again configured in MDM.

When the flow is classic photoshoot user the photo capture screen opens with camera on. In this screen at the top activity and image set type label in provided.  In this screen before photo capture if a planogram is assigned to that survey, activity, imageset type or to that store planogram selection pop up screen is shown so that user select one of the planogram thumbnails to provide input. If there is only one planogram then it is selected by default.

In MDM refer rules can be configured. One refer rule type is Planogram. Planograms are already collected or generated image sets that are offered to Shark users before or during photo capture. This plongrams are stitched images used as a refer to evaluate if SKUs in collected images are in same order with the selected planograms.

In classic capture after planogram selection user selects left tor right or right to left option again for configured projects. 

In MDM there is a camera config model and in camera config this selection can be enabled or disabled so not all Shark users see left to right or rgiht to left selection pop up screen.

After planogram, and direction selections for configured project the standard photo capture can begin. User captures and image and after capture user select the direction. The aim is forming a grid of images of the retail scene. For example user can select continue right, continue buttom, continue upper right depending on the grid position.  User can use torch button to activate flashlight for dark environments. User can select guidance button so that part of the previously collected image is shown to direct user capture stitchable images meaning overlapping images.
User can select POG button to alter the previosuly selected planogram. User can select grid button to see all collected images in grid mode. 

Grid screen is another screen that can be opened during photo capture. All collected images are shown in small images in the order they are collected in grid form. User can delete, retake, or new capture image by clicking on the grid images or by clicking + buttons to add new image where an image is not yet collected, user can use back button to return photo capture.

When an image is taken Shark checks blurriness and informs user about the image collected. User can accept or retake the guided image.
Each time an image is collected user have to option to change equipment. This is a shurtcut to coninue standard photoshoot by initiating antoher imageset.
To finish image capturing user presses Done button in iOS or red checkmark button in Android. And an image set data is collected.

User is navigated to Activity screen with and added image set card. User can continue adding new image sets an activity screen allows adding as many image set needed if the amount of imageset that can be collected is not limited in MDM.

When the flow is AR capture meaning in MDM the capture mode for this imageset type is set as AR then instead of classic photoshoot AR capture session begins. User scans the scene and a plane is detected. User points the camera to plane and AR captures zones. In this session captures zones are automatically stitiched and shown as panorama image at the top of the sceen during AR capture process. When the shooting ends the panorama image is shown to user and user clicks Done in iOS or Check in Android to end image set capturing with AR process.

User can return Visit screen by pressing back button in Activity screen. In Visit Screen all collected activities are listed and Upload option is provided to user. If the user is online and upload button is pressed the visit is sent to Ocean backend with all data hierarchy and images collected under image sets. If user is offline this visit is shown as waiting upload in Store selection screen. If user not uploads visit and just uses back navigation to return store selection screen then this visit is shown as Ongoing Visit at the top of Store cards in Store selection screen.

When user is online Shark silently sends the waiting upload visits.

CPG executives use Ocean as of Storesense solution. Ocean is a web reporting platform that provides reports from Shark visits in Storesense solution.  Shark visits are uploaded to Ocean backend.
Ocean backend is an orchestration layer uses sidekick tool send each imageset to Core.

Core product is used to process imagesets. Imagesets and the images within imagesets are sent to Core so that Core processes this imageset with already trained machine learning models. These models are refered as AI ML engines. There is a cropnet (detection) engine that detects the position of the objects in retail scenario these are SKUs(products) are Non SKUs (posters, light on, light off, blurry). Cropnet produces crops. Crops are simple an image of a SKU or non SKU as a result of detection that is cropped from the retail image. There is skunet(recognition) engine that produces a detection result and in this result crops are now labeled as sku1, sku2 meaning that now crops are labeled as real SKUs and engine result tells that SKU or Non SKU is found.

In MDM there is SKU and NON SKU model. SKU has CPG's product name, decription, size, unit, decription, type such as own, competitor, independent, tags in from of json that can hold hierarchical data for example category, subcategory, detailed category, producer, brand, main thumbnail (view) image or zero or many variant thumbnails (views), meta information. Non SKU is another model, in this model a representative thumnail(view) exists, name, description of non sku is entered. In MDM there is a model called sku group. One or many SKU can be added to a sku group. For example in retail must have sku grouping is common. Some of the SKU master data or SKU universe in MDM can be added into a created must have group. SKU groups can be tagged with json format for example tag: must_have is can be added to a sku group.  In MSM class group is another model. One sku group can be configured to a class group and one or many non sku's can be added to a class group. This class groups are then added to another MDM model processing context. A processing context can hold one or many class groups. Processing context model in MDM is the definition so that Ocean can send an image set to Core and also Ocean can send which SKUs and NON Skus will be sent to corresponding Core engines.  In processing context configuration there are mapping fields and these are survey, activity category, image set type. A visit also has this information so Shark orchestration can decide generate a Core task with this details. Processing context also holds task type information. For example if the task is stitichedDetectionTask then this information is also added to Core task. 

Once the task is put to Core'S queue with class group details (SKUs, NON SKUs) and task type then Core engines are executed in sequence depending on the task type. For example if task type is 
stitichedDetectionTask then images are detected, stitched, recognized and result is produced. Eash task type has its own engines that has to be run by Core.

When core result is produced Ocean sends this result and MDM master data (SKU, STORE,SKU GROUP, REFER RULE(PLANOGRAM) details ) as inputs to KPI Engine which is the reporting data generation product of Storesense solution. A visit consists of imagesets so there are two KPI engines in projects one is image set reported and other is visit reported. Each image set is reported and finally all image set reports are used as input to visit reported and KPI engine produces final report.  Visit report is added to Visit metadata json in Ocean backend. Imageset reports are also added in relation with Visit in Ocean backend.
KPI engine calculates scores, produces in store exection tasks in format of tables under extras section, produces details for each SKU such as SKU's must have = true or SKU's facing count is 1.

Visits with reports are indexed with Elastic in Ocean backend and served to Ocean in APIs.
Visits with reports in PostgeSQL are serviced to Mobile Reports app in Shark. Mobile Reports is instead a web page that is rendered online in Shark. It is part of the solution and referred as another products within solution.

When visit report or imageset report is generated a notification is sent to Shark. User receives visit report ready notification and when clicked user is navigated to online report page. This web view content is rendered within a from in iOS and Android screen. User can see KPI engine gerenerated scores, in store tasks in table formats, view collected image sets and images, view stitiched panorama images, reach each image set report by clicking image set report icon. Each acitivty and imageset type is listed in this Visit report. User can also click image set reported button for each imageset and reach a realogram view of the retail scene.

First Dashboard in Ocean web reporting platform is Visit Dashboard. In this dashboard there is left pane filter. CPG executives chose a date range in this filter and all visits within that data range are filtered and listed in a table. Above table the aggreagated scores are shown in score cards that are produced by KPI engine. KPI engine also produce category scores meaning Ocean user can see Overall scores by default or select a sub SKU category to check that categories's scores. In this case all scores shown in table, score cards are category scores."
